## Command
_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 round

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.

**_Approach._** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

**_Drop._** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

**_Flee._** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**_Grovel._** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

**_Halt._** The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Compelled-Duel
_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

## Silent-Image
_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

## Find-Steed
_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close – within 30 feet – at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

## Zone-of-Truth
_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

## Spirit-Shroud
_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around you for the spell’s duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they are good or evil (your choice). Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. This damage is radiant if the spirits are good and necrotic if they are evil. Any creature that takes this damage can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Banishment

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another place of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence that the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spells ends.

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close – within 30 feet – at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being unfer the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature.

This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Divine energy radiates from you, distorting and diffusing magical energy within 30 feet of you. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.

• **Break Enchantment.** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

• **Dismissal.** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they are already on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.

## Geas
_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 30 days

You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide.

If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse), [Greater Restoration](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration), or [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell also ends it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

## Raise-Dead
_5th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival – its head, for instance – the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

## Summon-Celestial-Spirit
_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a golden reliquary worth at least 500 gp)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a spirit from the Upper Planes. The spirit manifests physically in an angelic form in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Celestial Spirit stat block below. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or Defender. Your choice determines the creature’s attack in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell’s level in its stat block.
